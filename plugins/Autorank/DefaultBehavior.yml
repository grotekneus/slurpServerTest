# This file allows you to change the default behavior of a path. 
# For example, if you change 'ALLOW_INFINITE_PATHING' to true, all paths will by default allow infinite pathing, unless specified otherwise by setting it to false for a path.
# If you're unsure about the option, please consult the wiki about what they mean. 
# Moreover, be careful with changing defaults: it can ruin your Autorank setup!
